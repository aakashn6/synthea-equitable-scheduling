# Synthea-Based Equitable Scheduling Under Demand Uncertainty

This project explores equitable anesthesiologist scheduling using synthetic patient data generated by Synthea. It models daily procedure demand and uses CVaR-based planning to allocate staff under uncertainty.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `data/`: Raw Synthea CSV data (e.g., procedures.csv)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook used for analysis
- `charts/`: Output plots for demand, staffing, and fairness
- `docs/`: Project description and explanation document
- `src/`: Optional Python scripts (converted from notebook)

## ▶️ To Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open `notebooks/synthea_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Run each cell to reproduce the analysis and plots

## 📈 Sample Visuals
See charts in `/charts` for procedure demand and staffing trends.
